# Horse:Link

## Abstract
HorseLink is a decentralized finance platform that enables bookmakers to borrow against their book of wagers from a pool of lender supplied capital. Lenders receive competitive interest, and the platform charges a fee to facilitate the transaction.

HorseLink leverages decentralized smart contracts to escrow funds securely and uses a market-based risk scoring mechanism to determine the lending rate to each bookmaker. The platform is powered by its ERC-20 token “HL'' to facilitate payments and bets.

## Background

* Horse racing has an estimated global annual economic impact of around USD 300 billion.
* Europe and USA account for over two-thirds of this market; with a greater economic impact than the motion picture industry.
* Worldwide prize money for horse racing reaches USD 3.5 billion annually with global betting industry for horse racing generating over USD 116 billion in revenue every year.
* Sports betting, too, contributes significantly to the economy, adding nearly USD 87 billion in 2022 with a projected CAGR over 10.3% through 2030.

## Problem

* Despite the size of the industry, advancements in the way sports betting is handled has not evolved significantly for decades.
* Options for online betting are limited to a few global players, with high fees and the need to transact in fiat.
* This limits accessibility and growth which stalls demand and limits the size of the industry.
* However, today, significant advancements in blockchain technologies enable the use of cryptographic tokens to transfer, and lend value – opening up a new cohort of potential players.
* Furthermore, these advancements in the crypto sector has led to the explosive growth of an entirely new category called decentralized finance (DeFi).
* Currently there’s nearly USD 51 billion in total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols.
* This evolution in finance has enabled new sources of lending and liquidity.
* We believe that when combined with the horse racing and sports betting industries, the liquidity can help drive significant expansion in the market.

## The solution

HorseLink is a protocol that leverages DeFi to provide newfound lending and liquidity to bookmakers in the horse racing and sports betting industry.

* By providing more liquidity, bookmakers can increase the volume and size of their book, expanding access in the industry.
* HorseLink also enables simplified and decentralized access to betting, greatly opening up accessibility to the crypto markets.
* HorseLink is powered by its ERC-20 token “HL” which operates on the Ethereum ecosystem to enable punters and speculators to place bets.
* Speculators can also resell their bets on the secondary market.
