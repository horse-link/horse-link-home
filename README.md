# Horse Link

HorseLink is a token-powered liquidity platform that connects lenders, bookkeepers, punters
and speculators together. Lenders fund vaults, which in turn finances a bookkeepers position,
enabling them to manage a high volume of punters and speculators. HorseLink provides an
escrow contract to assure that loss payouts occur, and works with a series of decentralized
oracles to gather race outcome information to release escrow payments.
